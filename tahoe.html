								<h3>Day 1</h3>
								<p>On our very first day, my family and I drove from the Bay up to Tahoe. We were planning on staying at Tahoe for the weekend with 5 other families. The drive was so long, and we spent most of the
								time singing along to songs or sleeping. We reached Tahoe in the evening and we got to see the house. It was huge, but super creepy. There were trees and woods behind
								the house, and we took some really great pictures in nature. That evening, we drove down to a pizza place. We had to buy some bug-repellant bracelets since there were so many bugs everywhere.
								When we got back, we played charades until 1:00 at night. </p>

								<h3>Day 2</h3>
								<p>On the second day, we had to get up pretty early. We drove down to the beach, but on our way there, we decided to climb some rocks to see
								a really nice view. My shoes were in the trunk and I didn't get there, and so clumsy me, of course, slipped and hurt my toe. I stuck a band-aid on and still went to the beach LOL. We wanted to
								go motorboated, but they wouldn't let us since my sister and I are under 18. So instead, we went kayaking and had so much fun!! After spending most of the day at the beach,
								we headed back and played more games. </p>

								<h3>Day 3</h3>
								<p>Our last day. I really didn't want this to end because I had soooo much summer homework to finish. We started packing up all of things and we all left the house. On our way back, we
								found another beach and we hung out there for a while. We had In n Out for lunch and went back home. The car ride was really long and once again, we slept most of the way home. I
								found that this experience wouldn't have been so amazing without my friends and family. We had such an amazing time away from the hustle and bustle of the bay area and being around nature. </p>

									<h3>Day 1</h3>
									<p>My family and I drove down to Los Angeles, where the cruise would be leaving. We were going on a cruise to Enseñada with our huge friend group,
									totaling about 40 people. Once we all got onto the cruise, we went to our rooms and then started exploring. The boat had a huge pool and water slides, and we
									planned to go the next day. After having some dinner, we went to a game show that was happening on the cruise. We watched for a while and then went to sleep. </p>

									<h3>Day 2</h3>
									<p>Our very first day on the cruise, my friends and I checked out the pools and waterslides. We went swimming and afterwards, we all hung out and played some card games. There was a safety meeting that
										all passengers were required to attend, We sat there awhile and we were shown around the huge boat and the emergency exits.
										After the safety meeting, we all hung out and played more games, and then got ready for dinner.
										We decided to dress nice and did our hair.
										After getting ready, there were photo booths all over the cruise, so we took a bunch of fancy pics. Dinner was super fancy and the food was delicious.
										We all went up to the top deck after dinner and played golf! Then, we stayed up until 1AM playing bluff and UNO.
									</p>

									<h3>Day 3</h3>
									<p>Today was the day we reached Mexico. We saw this blowhole that threw water at us. My friends and I explored the streets and saw a bunch of really cool things.
										After a while, we headed back to the cruise and played more games. They had a Harry Potter trivia competition and my sister and I were both winners! It was super fun.
										Afterwards, we explored all of the shops on the ship  - we saw the candy shop, which was my fave store out of all of them.
										Then, we all headed back to our rooms to get ready for another dinner. We got dresses and went to more photo booths for even more pictures. Lastly, we went to dinner. Our dessert was chocolate lava cake, which
										was delicious. After dinner. there was a magician doing tricks, so we all went to watch. At the end of the show, we all went to bed. The next day, the cruise would be over and we would head back to the bay area.
									</p>

									<h3>Day 4</h3>
									<p>The last day. We all packed our luggage and got off of the cruise. We said goodbye to our friends, some of which would be staying in LA and some who would be coming back to the bay area with us.
										It was early morning, so we started the drive back. I would tptally recommend going to Enseñada, but I must say, I found that I had more fun on the
									cruise rather than in Mexico. My advice - go with friends. </p>

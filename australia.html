									<h3>Melbourne</h3>
									<p>Melbourne was our very first destination in Australia. I left CA a week before winter break started with my mom.
										My sister and father would be joining us a week later since my sister couldn't skip her finals.
									The family we have in Australia lives in Melbourne, so we stayed at their house.
									My aunt and uncle had just had a baby, an adorable little boy.
									My mom and I hung out at their house for the week, and I had to do all of the homework I would be missing for the week I was skipping school.
									I had so much fun playing with the baby. We also visited rose gardens, which was super fun! I'm allergic to flowers but I wasn't affected by the slightest which was great!
								 	We also went into the city and saw a sunny Christmas for the first time! Although California is pretty warm, we do get some rain in the winter, so seeing the sky clear and huge Christmas trees
									was a bit of a shock. After the first week, my sister and father finally arrived. </p>

									<h3>Sydney</h3>
									<p>From Melbourne, we went straight to Sydney.
										My aunt, uncle and cousin didn't join us since my uncle still had to go to work for a few days.
										My family and I went to go see the Sydney Opera House, and a couple other super cool attractions.
										One of my cousins from my dad's side lives in Sydney, so we went out to have lunch with him.
										The second day, we climbed Harbour Bridge and went around Sydney City.
										We went to Bondi Beach and Blue Mountains. </p>

									<h3>Cairns</h3>
									<p>My uncle, aunt, and cousin joined us at Cairns. We went on boat to get to the Great Barrier Reef.
									We all got so seasick on the boat! Once we reached, we all had lunch and went scuba diving. After that,
									my sister and I went on these underwater motorcycles and drove around the bottom of the reef! It was by far the coolest experience!
									The next day, we went to Kuranda Skyrail and a train tour around Queensland. Then, we were off to Adelaide. </p>

									<h3>Adelaide</h3>
									<p>Once we were at Adelaide, we spent most of our time at Kangaroo Island. We took a ferry to Cape Jervis, which was super fun!! The
									most exciting part was seeing kangaroos and koalas in the wild.</p>

									<h3>Hobart</h3>
									<p>Our last stop in Australia was Hobart. We were all sad that we would be leaving soon, but Hobart was suck an amazing place.
									We went the Coles Bay and pretty much explored the whole place.
									It sucked that we would be leaving, but the entire trip was so much fun, being with family and having so many adventures. Overall, I would 100% recommend visiting Australia. The only thing I would say is to find a really good travel agent.
								I'm thankful that my uncle knew the best places to go, but if we had gone alone, I definately wouldn't have had so much fun. </p>

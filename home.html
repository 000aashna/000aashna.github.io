											<h3>Playa del Carmen, Cancún</h3>
											<p> I went to Cancún this summer before my sophomore year.
												My family and I took a flight to Phoenix.
												From there, we took a second flight to Cancún.
												The moment we stepped outside, I realized that this was nothing like California.
												The weather was sweltering and humid, unlike California's hot n dry weather.
												We rented our car for the trip, so after we picked it up, we drove two hours to get to the resort we were staying in, the Royal Haciendas. It took my sister and I forever to find a good radio channel that we agreed on. I love Spanish music, so we had a lot of fun singing and listening to songs.
												Once we got to the resort, it felt like paradise. We got our keys and went up to the room.
												I was flabbergasted at the view from our balcony. We had the view of the pools and the ocean right in front of us.
												We had planned for the trip to be mostly relaxing, with a couple of adventures. Over the next week, we climbed some ancient ruins, got out feet cleaned by fish, and went ziplining and parasailing. Check out my daily entries for more!

											<h3>Australia</h3>
											<p>I went to Australia in December to visit my family and my new baby cousin. I spent three weeks visiting different cities with my family.
												I visited Melbourne, Sydney, Cairns, Adelaide, and Hobart. I fed kangaroos, went on a motor boat trip, saw a sunny Christmas, went underwater motorbiking in the
												Great Barrier Reef, and so much more. This was such an amazing experience and my experience there is one of the reasons I decided to make this blog. Check out my day-by-day entries for more!</p>

																<h3><a href="#">Birthday Celebrations!</a></h3>
															</header>
															<p>Happy Birthday to my sister! Today my sister turned 17!!
																We all got up early and went to breakfast.
																We took a course on kayaking and then kayaked around on the beach for a while.
																We walked down the beach until we reached a small hut, where we used their gear and went parasailing.
																The view was to die for! We went on a scooter further from the coast and sat on a motorboat until it was our turn to go up.
																After a while, they brought us back down from the air and we went back to land. Not gonna lie, I was pretty happy to be standing on solid things again. Almost everyone in my family gets boat-sick, and unfortunately, I'm no exception. It took me a few minutes
																to regain my senses, but I have to say, it was so amazing!
																My mom, sister, and I went to the spa. After that, we all got ready in nice clothes and took photos to celebrate! At the restaurant, my dad had been joking around that he had asked the guitarist to sing happy birthday to my sister. She was mortified and asked him not to.
																But the guitarist played "happy birthday" to my sister, to which
																she was mortified. While they were saying happy birthday, they said it to my mom, because she was the one who made the reservation. It was so funny and we all had a great day! :)</p>

																<h3><a href="#">Ziplining and River Rafting</a></h3>
															</header>
															<p>On my fourth day in Cancún, my family and I decided to go xPlor Park. This was one of the best experiences I have ever had.
																I got to zipline, river raft, sit on hammocks that fell into the water, and swim through a waterfall. It was really funny that they wouldn't let me zipline on my own because apparently, I wasn't heavy enough. But for the last two ziplines, they did, and it was worth the wait.
																We went on the hammock so many times, we became friends with some of the employees of the park. The park also offered a delicious lunch, and there were so many activities for different age groups. This was probably my favorite day in the whole vacation.

													<h3><a href="#">Climbing Ancient Mayan Ruins</a></h3>
												</header>
												<p>On our third day in Cancún, my family and I went to visit some Mayan ruins. We first went to Coba, where we climbed a pyramid in sweltering heat.
													After coming back down, I genuinely thought my legs would give up on me. I don't think I have even been so tired in my life.
													After seeing Coba, we went to Tulum, and we saw so many ruins right by the beach.
													We walked around for a while, and then swam around in the water to cool off. When we got back to our rented car, it wouldn't start! It was so hot, and we were still sweaty from climbing the pyramids. I was honestly feeling a little faint since it had been so hot and we had done so much climbing and walking.
													But eventually, the car started and I almost cried from relief. Overall, this was one of the most tiring days, but also one of the most fun.

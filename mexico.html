										<h2>Playa del Carmen, Cancún</h2>

									<h3>June 24/25</h3>
									<p>We reached the hotel at about 12 in the afternoon. We had two previous flights, one from SF to Phoenix.
										From there, we took a second flight from Phoenix to Cancún. We rented a car and drove about two hours to reach the hotel.
										Once we were checked in, we went upstairs to check out our suite. The view from our balcony was stunning.
										All of us were starving so we went downstairs to check out where we would have lunch.
										After eating, most of us took naps because we were so exhausted from the flights to get here.
										After a couple of hours, we decided to go explore the hotel.
										We found that the hotel had two huge pool with bars, and several smaller ones.
										We talked to the lady that helps with activies (totally forgot what her name was)
										and looked around at the different rooms. We signed up for a timeshare meeting for tomorrow
										since we didn't have any plans. We went back to the restaurant for dinner and went to sleep. </p>
									<p>Today is the 25th. I decided to combine both days into one category because today was pretty boring as well.
										We got up and got ready for breakfast.
										Afterwards, all four of us went to the timeshare meeting and while our parents were shown around the different kinds of rooms they could buy, my sister and I just hung out and ate a complimentary lunch.
										When my parents got back, one of the people there told us we could get free massages since we came to the meeting.
										We booked the massages for the 29th, since it was my sisters birthday and we could have fun with it.
										We went our for lunch after the timeshare since my parents didn't get much to eat. Afterwards, we all went to the pool and hung out for a while. It was a lit day :)
									</p>

									<h3>June 26</h3>
									<p>On our third day in Cancún, my family and I went to visit some Mayan ruins.
										We first went to Coba, where we climbed a pyramid in sweltering heat.
										After coming back down, I genuinely thought my legs would give up on me.
										I don't think I have even been so tired in my life.
										After seeing Coba, we went to Tulum, and we saw so many ruins right by the beach.
										We walked around for a while, and then swam around in the water to cool off.
										Overall, one of the most tiring days, but also the most fun.
									</p>

									<h3>June 27</h3>
									<p>Today, my family and I had plans to go a park called xPlor.
										This was one of the best experiences I have ever had.
										I got to zipline, river raft, sit on hammocks that fell into the water, and swim through a waterfall.
										They had this huge ziplining course and it was sooo much fun. The person there didn't let me zipline alone though because he said I didn't weigh enough
										and the wind was blowing in a certain direction so that my zipline would reach the end. That sucked, but I got to go alone on the last two
										courses so it wasn't all that bad :) The park offered a delicious lunch, and there were so many activities for different age groups.
										We also swam through caves with little fishies and at the end of the course, we all swam through a waterfall. It was crazy cool!
								</p>

									<h3>June 28</h3>
									<p>Today was another relaxing day. We woke up, had some lunch, and got ready for the day. We decided to visit one of the sister hotels of the Royal Haciendas, called
										
									</p>

									<h3>June 29</h3>
									<p>Happy Birthday to my sister! Today my sister turned 17!!
										We all got up early and went to breakfast.
										We took a course on kayaking and then kayaked around on the beach for a while.
										We walked down the beach until we reached a small hut, where we used their gear and went parasailing.
										The view was to die for! We went on a scooter further from the coast and sat on a motorboat until it was our turn to go up.
										After a while, they brought us back down from the air and we went back to land. Not gonna lie, I was pretty happy to be standing on solid things again.
										My mom, sister, and I went to the spa. After that, we all got ready in nice clothes and took photos to celebrate! We went to the restaurant, where the guitarist played "happy birthday" to my sister, to which
										she was mortified. It was a great day! :)</p>
